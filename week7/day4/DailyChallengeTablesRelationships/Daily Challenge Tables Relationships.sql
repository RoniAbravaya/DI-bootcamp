-- Part I

-- Create 2 tables : Customer and Customer profile. They have a One to One relationship.

-- A customer can have only one profile, and a profile belongs to only one customer
-- The Customer table should have the columns : id, first_name, last_name NOT NULL
-- The Customer profile table should have the columns : id, isLoggedIn DEFAULT false (a Boolean), customer_id (a reference to the Customer table)

-- Insert those customers

-- John, Doe
-- Jerome, Lalu
-- Lea, Rive

-- Insert those customer profiles, use subqueries

-- John is loggedIn
-- Jerome is not logged in

-- Use the relevant types of Joins to display:

-- The first_name of the LoggedIn customers
-- All the customers first_name and isLoggedIn columns - even the customers those who donâ€™t have a profile.
-- The number of customers that are not LoggedIn


-- Part II:

-- Create a table named Book, with the columns : book_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, title NOT NULL, author NOT NULL

-- Insert those books :
-- Alice In Wonderland, Lewis Carroll
-- Harry Potter, J.K Rowling
-- To kill a mockingbird, Harper Lee

-- Create a table named Student, with the columns : student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name NOT NULL UNIQUE, age. Make sure that the age is never bigger than 15 (Find an SQL method);

-- Insert those students:
-- John, 12
-- Lera, 11
-- Patrick, 10
-- Bob, 14

-- Create a table named Library, with the columns :
-- book_fk_id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
-- student_id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
-- borrowed_date
-- This table, is a junction table for a Many to Many relationship with the Book and Student tables : A student can borrow many books, and a book can be borrowed by many children
-- book_fk_id is a Foreign Key representing the column book_id from the Book table
-- student_fk_id is a Foreign Key representing the column student_id from the Student table
-- The pair of Foreign Keys is the Primary Key of the Junction Table

-- Add 4 records in the junction table, use subqueries.
-- the student named John, borrowed the book Alice In Wonderland on the 15/02/2022
-- the student named Bob, borrowed the book To kill a mockingbird on the 03/03/2021
-- the student named Lera, borrowed the book Alice In Wonderland on the 23/05/2021
-- the student named Bob, borrowed the book Harry Potter the on 12/08/2021

-- Display the data
-- Select all the columns from the junction table
-- Select the name of the student and the title of the borrowed books
-- Select the average age of the children, that borrowed the book Alice in Wonderland
-- Delete a student from the Student table, what happened in the junction table ?

-- Customer table

-- Customer Profile table

-- Number of customers not LoggedIn
SELECT COUNT(*) AS not_loggedin_count

-- Book table
CREATE TABLE Book (

-- Student table
CREATE TABLE Student (
    student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    age INTEGER CHECK (age <= 15)

-- Library table
CREATE TABLE Library (
    book_fk_id INTEGER REFERENCES Book(book_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    student_fk_id INTEGER REFERENCES Student(student_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,

);

-- Insert books
INSERT INTO Book (title, author) VALUES
('Alice In Wonderland', 'Lewis Carroll'),

-- Insert students
INSERT INTO Student (name, age) VALUES
('John', 12),

-- Insert records in the junction table

((SELECT book_id FROM Book WHERE title = 'Harry Potter'), (SELECT student_id FROM Student WHERE name = 'Bob'), '2021-08-12');


-- Select all columns from the junction table
SELECT * FROM Library;

-- Select student names and borrowed book titles
SELECT Student.name, Book.title

SELECT AVG(Student.age) AS avg_age

-- Delete a student from the Student table
DELETE FROM Student WHERE name = 'John';

-- Display data after deletion
SELECT * FROM Library; -- The corresponding records in the junction table will also be deleted due to ON DELETE CASCADE.
